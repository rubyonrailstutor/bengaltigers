### Talk about regroup

- concerns over efficacy of following the restaurantly app before really building any fundamental models to understand how to program
- the role of having ritual in class and adhering to it, why git is the fundamental flow of all classes
- introduce the coders checklist
- as an instructor, i feel our energy is a bit off track and I want to correct that
- every class starts and end with a log-post, expectation, observations/outcomes, commits


### TODO
- Figure out how to do soft tab in sublie with 2 spaces.
#  "tab_size": 2,
#  "translate_tabs_to_spaces": true
